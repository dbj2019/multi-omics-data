# Day 3: Applications to a dataset of choice

*Duration*: 1h + 1h + 2h


## Outline
Today, all participants will have the opportunity to work on their own data or select a dataset of interest. Here, they can implement the learnt strategies for data integration for the data set at hand and prepare a reproducible analysis vignette to interpret the results obtained. At all stages they will receive feedback and recommendations by the trainers and are encouraged to exchange and team up with participants working on related data. Everyone is expected to present the results of their analysis at the end of the course to the other participants.
