# Day 2:  Single cell multi-omics integration using muon

*Topics*:  normalization strategies, clustering,  visualization,CITE-seq, scNMT-seq data, muon, weightest nearest neighbors analysis, MOFA+

*Duration*: 1,5h + 2h

## Outline

Today we will learn how to use the muon framework for multi-modal analysis of single cell data, covering important data formats for single cell data, normalization strategies, clustering and visualization. In groups of 3-4 people, they will apply this framework for the analysis of multimodal single cell data such as CITE-seq or scNMT-seq data. During this, they will learn about weightest nearest neighbors analysis and discover more advanced options of the MOFA method from day 1 such as integration of data with distinct groups of samples and learn how it can be interfaced with the muon framework.
