# Day 1 - Integrative analysis of bulk-assay data sets

*Topics*: data handling, pre-processing, integration using MOFA, troubleshooting, results interpretation

*Duration*: 2 x 1.5h

## Outline
Today we will get familiar with the MOFA method and work with bulk multi-omics data such as a data set on leukemia samples covering RNA-seq, methylation, drug response and genomic data. Here, participants will learn how to prepare and normalize the data for an integrative analysis and what data containers can be useful (e.g., MultiAssayExperiment). Once set up, the practical will show how to call the method on the data, make use of basic options and address any issues that can arise. In groups of 3-4 people, the participants will then discover different ways to interpret the results and perform different kinds of down-stream analyses, such as enrichment analysis, clustering, outlier detection.
